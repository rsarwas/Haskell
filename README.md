Haskell
=======

This repo contains code related to my attempts to learn [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/).
Specifically it contains my solutions to [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/) problems in Haskell,
and my solutions to [99 Haskell Problems](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems).

This repo should be private to honor the ethos of Project Euler, but I'm too much of a
cheapskate to pay for a private github account, so I am relying on any readers who stumble
upon this repo to avoid looking at solutions to problems you have not already solved yourself.
