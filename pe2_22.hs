--  Using names.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 46K text file containing over five-thousand first names, begin by
-- sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working out the alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by its
-- alphabetical -- position in the list to obtain a name score.

-- For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name -- in the list. So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938  53 = 49714.

-- What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
